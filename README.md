# etch-a-sketch

to do 

- disable grid resizing for button after its been created until reset
- change hover/click option for drawing
- consider how items can only be drawn from a local scope again? i.e. js line 16
- if input is larger than 100 or less than 1, say error

-try to run the create grid before hand to allow 'items' to be on a global scale
-clear the board and reset the board to the input when the submit button is pressed
