# etch-a-sketch

Part of the Odin Project Curriculum

Hello! This was by far the most complicated project so far, but the most rewarding to see it come together in the end. I learned about how to use simple animations, implement more efficient DOM practices, and overall gained more practice and insight as to how to manage my code. For anyone who is reading, I am extremely aware that my code is far from clean, but I'm very glad that it all works! I will definitely be improving in the future for my overall organization and management.

(p.s. go see if theres anything near the bottom left of the page :))

To-Do's:
- make larger brush sizes
- canvas transition when formed
- fill bucket
- search how to use toggle


Finished:
- create brush that uses shading
- eraser
- clear the board and reset the board to the input when the submit button is pressed
- change hover/click option for drawing
- consider how items can only be drawn from a local scope again? i.e. js line 16
- if input is larger than 100 or less than 1, say error
- allow color picker to choose any color at all
- random colors
- maybe get sprites?
- cleanup layout
- toggle grid
- fill background
- make canvas auto create grid
