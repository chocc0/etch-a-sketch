# etch-a-sketch

to do 

- change hover/click option for drawing
- consider how items can only be drawn from a local scope again? i.e. js line 16
- if input is larger than 100 or less than 1, say error
- cleanup layout
- allow color picker to choose any color at all
- maybe get sprites?




-clear the board and reset the board to the input when the submit button is pressed
